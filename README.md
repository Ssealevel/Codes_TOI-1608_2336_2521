# Transiting BD and low mass star list and some codes for TOI-1608, 2336, and 2521 paper (Lin et al. 2023)

This repository contains the brown dwarf and low mass star list as well as some codes used in [Lin et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221013939L/abstract).

## BD and low mass star list

The transiting BD and low mass star list is in "BD_list_2022-10.txt". This list is based on the list in [Grieves et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...652A.127G/abstract) and add NGTS-19b ([Acton et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.2741A/abstract)), TOI-2119b ([Ca√±as et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...89C/abstract); [Carmichael et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4944C/abstract)), TIC-320687387 B ([Gill et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.1785G/abstract)), 
TOI-629b, TOI-1982b, and TOI-2543b ([Psaridi et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...664A..94P/abstract)). I also add the targets of our paper to this list.

## Plot inflation

The codes to fit the correlation between the flux and the radius for brown dwarfs and for low-mass stars and plot the Figure 12 and 13 are 
in the folder "Plot_BD_inflation". The planet list "PS_2022.05.29_05.24.22.csv" used in these codes is from [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).
The BD and low mass star list used in this folder does **NOT** include the targets of our paper.

## Plot model

The codes to plot the Figure 11 are in the folder "Plot_BD_model". The "*Gyr.txt" files in this folder is modified 
from the files provided by [Baraffe et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...577A..42B/abstract). The folder "phillips2020" is from [Phillips et al. (2020b)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...637A..38P/abstract). 
The BD and low mass star list used in this folder does **NOT** include the targets of our paper.

## Plot eccentricity

The codes to plot the Figure 14 are in the folder "Plot_BD_e". 
The BD and low mass star list used in this folder does **NOT** include the targets of our paper.
