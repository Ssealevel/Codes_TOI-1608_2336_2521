# Transiting brown dwarf list and some codes for TOI-1608, 2336, and 2521 paper (Lin et al. 2023)

This Repository contains the brown dwarf list as well as some codes used in Lin et al. (2023).

## BD list

The transiting BD list is in "BD_list_2022-10.txt". This list is based on the list in by Grieves et al. (2021) and add NGTS-19b (Acton et al. 2021), 
TOI-1278 B (Artigau et al. 2021), TOI-2119b (Ca√±as et al. 2022; Carmichael et al. 2022), TIC-320687387 B (Gill et al. 2022), 
TOI-629b, TOI-1982b, and TOI-2543b (Psaridi et al. 2022). I also add the targets of our paper to this list.

## Plot BD's inflation

The codes to fit the correlation between the flux and the radius for brown dwarfs and for low-mass stars and plot the Figure 12 and 13 are 
in the folder "Plot_BD_inflation". The planet list "PS_2022.05.29_05.24.22.csv" used in these codes is from NASA Exoplanet Archive.
The BD list used in this folder does NOT include the targets of our paper.

## Plot BD's model

The codes to plot the Figure 11 are in the folder "Plot_BD_model". The "*Gyr.txt" files in this folder is modified 
from the files provided by Baraffe et al. (2015). The folder "phillips2020" is from Phillips et al. (2020b). 
The BD list used in this folder does NOT include the targets of our paper.

## Plot BD's eccentricity

The codes to plot the Figure 14 are in the folder "Plot_BD_e". 
The BD list used in this folder does NOT include the targets of our paper.
